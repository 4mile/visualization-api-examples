**Custom Funnel Diagram**

![funnel image](funnel.jpg "Funnel Visualization")

This diagram allows you to segment your data into sections of a funnel. Such as customers going through a sales pipeline, or events going to conversion. 

**How it works**

Create a look with one measure and one dimension. The sort is important, typically sort the measure DESC as the funnel follows this direction.

**Settings**

| Section | Setting Name | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Style | Width % | Allows the user to set a width of the funnel as a % of the cell/div |
| Style | 3D Funnel | Turning this on makes a 3D/Rounded funnel compared to the flat funnel |
| Style | Hover Effects | Darkens funnel section when hovered over |
| Style | Dynamic Area | Adjusts the segment heights based on the measure amount to be sized in proportion |
| Style | Gradient Effects | Visually adds a gradient to the colors of each segment |
| Style | Show Conversion Rate | Calculates percent of previous on the value label |
